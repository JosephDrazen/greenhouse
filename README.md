# greenhouse
A greenhouse automation project. The idea is to make a small herb garden into a smart greenhouse using a contained area with lighting, watering, and sensor functionaility. 

## Equipment List
  Part | Description 
  -----| -----
Rasberry Pi | We need something to run the code and control the sensors
  DHT11 | Temperature and humidity combined sensor with calibrated digital signal output. It's is a reliable sensor for determining temperature and humidity.
  Soil Moisture Sensor | Measuring moisture in soil
  Luminosity Sensor | Measuring light for various growth stages 
  12V power supply | 'Cause the Pi can't.
  
## Tech Stack
- Python to control the sensors, pi, and greenhouse
- JS, HTML, CSS to make a front end web app that displays useful data regarding the greenhouse 
- something to keep the data (not sure yet, gotta think that through!)
